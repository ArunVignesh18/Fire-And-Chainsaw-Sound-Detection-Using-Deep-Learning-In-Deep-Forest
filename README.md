# FIRE DETECTION AND ILLEGAL ACTION SOUNDS DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING IN DEEP FOREST

     This project can be used to detect fire occurance in deep forest through computer vision and detects chainsaw sounds which are illegal felling in the deep forest using deep learning by comparing their datasets.

# Setup 

      Once you downloaded the model from the gdriver , Place the model folder inside our teamstartup folder.
      Please make sure you have Anaconda3 setup in your computer to have conda environment 

# COMMANDS
     
     1. Open anaconda3 powershell
     2. Navigate to the folder (teamStartup)
     3. conda create --name your_environment_name
     4. conda activate your_environment_name
     5. conda install pip
     6. pip install -r requirements.txt
     7. pip install pipwin
     8. pipwin install pyaudio

# Run 

      Once you activated and installed all the packages in the environment its time to start.

      RUN : python.exe team_startup.py 

Running the experiment or detection requires that you have 
Tensorflow, OpenCV and PyAudio installed.
