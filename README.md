# FIRE DETECTION AND ILLEGAL ACTION SOUNDS DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING IN DEEP FOREST

     This project can be used to detect fire occurance in deep forest through computer vision and detects chainsaw sounds which are illegal felling in the deep forest using deep learning by comparing their datasets.

# COMMANDS
    
     1. Install conda env
     2. Navigate to the folder
     3. conda create --name your_environment_name
     4. conda activate your_environment_name
     5. conda install pip
     6. pip install -r requirements.txt
     7. pip install pipwin
     8. pipwin install pyaudio


Running the experiment or detection requires that you have 
Tensorflow, OpenCV and PyAudio installed. You can 
install this dependencies via the commands below.


- Tensorflow 1.4.0 (and later versions) Install or install via pip

      pip install --upgrade tensorflow 
- OpenCV Install or install via pip

      pip install opencv-python 
- Keras 2.x Install or install via pip

      pip install keras 
- PyAudio and Librosa

      pip install pyaudio
     
      pip install librosa
